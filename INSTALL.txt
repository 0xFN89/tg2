TurboGears2 Installation Guide
===============================

.. Note:: At current stage TurboGears2 is available testing by developers
    who are willing to use Subversion to track the latest changes.

Requirements
------------
While in Development there are several dependencies:

    * Python, version >= 2.4.
        + Please keep in mind, that for RPM-based systems you will also need
        python-devel and python-xml packages.
        + You may need python-dev and python-setuptools in ubuntu
    * Pylons Trunk checkout.
        We require the development version is preferable since there are important
        controller features which we need, as well as a template rendering bugfix
        which is nessisary for TurboJSON to work properly.

Installing TurboGears2
-----------------------
The command:

    $ python ./setup.py install

will byte-compile the python source code and install it in the
site-packages directory of your python installation.

If you don't already have the pylons and turbogears source, you can
get them from their repository::

    $ easy_install -U mercurial
    $ hg clone http://pylonshq.com/hg/pylons-dev pylons
    $ svn co http://svn.turbogears.org/trunk tg2

and install TurboGears 2 in development mode::

    $ python ./pylons/setup.py develop
    $ python ./tg2/setup.py develop

Update the source
-----------------

To update the source to the current develop version. Enter the tg2 folder and
type the command::

    $ svn update
    $ python setup.py develop

Creating a Quickstart Project
------------------------------

TurboGears2 is built on Pylons and share pylons' "paster" commands.
Enter command::

    $ paster --help

to get the availble command list.

The command::

    $ paster quickstart tutorial

will generate the "tutorial" package based on quickstart templates for you.


Running the Demo
-----------------

Enter the tutorial folder and type::

    $ paster serve development.ini

Browse http://127.0.0.1:8080 for demo.
