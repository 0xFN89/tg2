TurboGears2 Installation Guide
===============================

.. Note:: At current stage TurboGears2 is avaliable for developers.

Requirements
------------
To install TurboGears2, the following software packages must be installed:

 * Python, version >= 2.3.
   + Please keep in mind, that for RPM-based systems you will also need
   python-devel and python-xml packages.
 * Pylons version > 0.9.5
   + A development version is preferable since pylons' trunk had fixed some 
   bugs that we had cooperated with.

Installing TurboGears2
-----------------------
The command:

  $ python ./setup.py install

will byte-compile the python source code and install it in the
site-packages directory of your python installation.

Another way is getting the source from svn::

    $ svn co http://pylonshq.com/svn/Pylons/trunk pylons
    $ svn co http://svn.turbogears.org/trunk tg2

and install the source in development mode::

    $ python ./pylons/setup.py develop
    $ python ./tg2/setup.py develop
    
Update the source 
-----------------

To update the source to the current develop version. Enter the tg2 folder and type the command::

    $ svn update
 
Creating a Quickstart Project

TurboGears2 is built on Pylons and share pylons' "paster" commands.
Enter command::

    $ paster quickstart tutorial

will generate the "tutorial" package based on quickstart templates for you.
