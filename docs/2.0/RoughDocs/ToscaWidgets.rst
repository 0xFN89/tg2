============

ToscaWidgets are reusable web components. The idea is that a component with some complexity, such as a popup calendar or rich text editor, could be packaged into a self-contained unit.  The component should contain all javascript, css, resource files (such as images) and dynamic-data (values) interaction code.  The component can then be integrated into your application without the developer having to know about it's internal complexity.
