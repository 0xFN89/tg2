TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of new components, and to provide a fully custmizable WSGI enabled stack.  

At the moment TurboGears 2 is still in rapid development, and should only be used by those who are willing to put up with a little bit of API instability.  If you want to use TG2 at the moment, you will have to download SVN and Mercurial, and check both TG2 and Pylons out from their respective version control system:
