================================

:status: Unofficial


This is the staging area for all documents related to the upcoming TurboGears **2.0**. Not 1.0, not 1.1. 

Please do feel free to add to, edit, or ask questions about any of the documents on your page.  The vibrant and active user community is part of what makes TurboGears so great. And we're always looking for people who want to help TurboGears succeed by lending a hand with the documentation. If you want to jump right in and write a document, please read our `Contributing Docs to TurboGears <DocHelp>`_ Guide, and go for it. 

Of course, the easiest way to contribute is to use the comment field at the bottom of the page to add links to other places on the internet which might have more information about the topic. 

But remember, the Documentation on this page should all be related to TurboGears 2.0. If you're using something other than 2.0, please return to the FrontPage_ and select the correct major version.
