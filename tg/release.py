long_description="""
TurboGears brings together four major pieces to create an
easy to install, easy to use web megaframework. It covers
everything from front end (AJAX for the browser and server,
template engines in Python) to the controllers (http framework) to
the back end (Object Relational Model).

The TurboGears project is focused on providing documentation
and integration with these tools without losing touch
with the communities that already exist around those tools.

TurboGears is easy to use for a wide range of web applications.

The latest development version is available in
<a href="http://svn.turbogears.org/trunk#egg=turbogears-dev"
>the TurboGears subversion repository</a>."""
