TurboGears2
===========

Next generation Front-to-back web development megaframework built on Pylons.

TurboGears2, which provides a comprehensive web development toolkit, 
is a web framework that could create a database-driven, 
ready-to-extend application in minutes. 
All with designer friendly templates, easy AJAX on the browser side and on the server side, 
not a single SQL query in sight with code that is as natural as writing a function.
