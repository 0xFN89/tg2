TurboGears2
===========

Next generation Front-to-back web development megaframework built on Pylons.

TurboGears2, which provides a comprehensive web development toolkit, 
is a web framework that could create a database-driven, 
ready-to-extend application in minutes. 
All with designer friendly templates, easy AJAX on the browser side and on the server side, 
not a single SQL query in sight with code that is as natural as writing a function.

TurboGears is a project that is built upon a foundation of reuse and building up. 
In retrospect, much of the code that was home grown in the TurboGears project 
should have been released as independent projects that integrate with TurboGears.
